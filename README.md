# PUBLIC

Hello! I am VIDUSEN (@frontendvidu).

This folder contains the publicly accessible assets and content for websites and projects shared by me. It includes both reusable sections and complete web pages that form the structure and functionality of the website.

## Sections

The `Sections` folder contains reusable UI sections used throughout websites. Each sections is developed to be modular and can be easily integrated into different pages.

## Pages

The `Pages` folder contains complete web pages of the website. Each page is fully developed and includes all necessary sections and styles.


### Usage

Feel free to use the sections and pages in this repo as templates in your project.

Cheers with Love❤ and happy coding😊✌...
